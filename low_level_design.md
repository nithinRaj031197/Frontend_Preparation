# Low Level Design:

- Low Level Design refers to **_process of specifing and defining detailed design of a software systems_**.

# Steps involved in the low-level design:

1. ### Understanding requirements:
2. ### Defining the architecture:
3. ### Designing the components:
4. ### Defining protocols:
5. ### Creating UML diagrams:
6. ### Reviewing the design:
7. ### Refining the design:
8. ### Documenting the design:

# Benefits of Low-Level Design:

- ### Improved Quality
- ### Better Understanding
- ### Increased Reusability

# What is Object Oriented Design (OOD)?

- Object-oriented design (OOD) is a software design approach that models real-world objects and their interactions to solve complex problems. This includes encapsulating data and behavior in objects, using inheritance to share common characteristics and behaviors, polymorphism to handle multiple forms of objects, and abstraction to simplify complex systems. The purpose of OOD is to create scalable, maintainable and reusable software.

# What are the principles of object-oriented design?

The principles of object-oriented design (OOD) are:

- **_Encapsulation_**: Wrapping data and behavior within an object.

- **_Inheritance_**: Sharing the properties and behaviors of existing objects.

- **_Polymorphism_**: Allowing objects to take multiple forms.

- **_Abstraction_**: Hiding complexity by exposing only essential features.

- **_Composition_**: The combination of objects to create more complex behavior.

These principles aim to create flexible, maintainable and scalable software systems. They work together to improve modularity, reduce code duplication, and simplify the overall design.

# Are Object-Oriented Design and Low-Level Design the same?

- No, object-oriented design (OOD) and low-level design are different. They are two different software design approaches that are used at different stages of the software development process.

- Object-oriented design is a high-level approach to software design that focuses on modeling real-world objects and their interactions in systems. It uses the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to create a flexible and maintainable design that evolves over time.

- On the other hand, low-level design is a more detailed and technical approach to software design that focuses on implementing the system at the component level. It defines the algorithms, data structures and interfaces that will be used to build the system. The low-level design provides the foundation for the implementation of the system, but it also needs to provide a complete view of the system as a whole.

- **_In summary, OOD is used to model the problem and create a high-level design, while low-level design is used to implement the solution and provide detailed design of system components_**.
